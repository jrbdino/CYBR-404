One thing I learned from the Career Center Presentation is that it is very important to make connections and network with people, even when you aren't specifically looking for a job.  When you build connections early on, it increases the potential for opportunities later.  One thing that I am going to continue to work on is having solid conversations with employers at career fairs.  I've gone to the last 2 career fairs, and I want to continue to get better at confidently communicating with the recruiters.
